Cluster Processing

This set of programs takes location data as well as cluster data as input:
(1) merge location data
(2) merge clusters generated by the Warren Wolf Algorithm
(3) match "investigated site" data to the generated clusters using time and distance criteria
(4) aggregate per wolf clusters and generate "multi-wolf" clusters
(5) implement a range of checks and corresponding warning flags for human review
(6) automatically apply a set of (manually produced) edits 

Refer to the Cluster Processing User Guide for more details.
